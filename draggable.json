    "Your task on the computer is to make judgments about the \"relatedness\" of pairs of terms that have to do with a task. There are several ways one might think about the terms being judged. For instance, two terms might be related because they share common features or because they frequently occur together. For this task think about the terms as they relate to performing the task.",

    "The major goal of the task is to achieve a goal. This is accomplished by: (1) First sub-goal description, (2) Second sub-goal description, and (3) A third sub-goal description. Thus, when making your relatedness judgments you should think about the task terms in relation to these 3 sub-goals.",
